#  Six signs of a strong frendship

True frendship is about trusting one another. While acquaintance or work colleagues may hide their shortcomings from youï¼Œa friend confides in you 

They like you for the real you. As humans, we are never perfect. Whatever your thing is, a true friend likes you not despite it - but because that's what makes you, you. They are not judgemental - they don't come down harshly and critically on your weaknesses.

They allow space for your freak-outs. When you get flustered,frustrated and can't keep it together, a friend is there for you. "They don't just flatter,they understand hoe easily we lose perspective,panic and underestimate our own ability ti cope," de Botton explains.

They are a beacon during moments when you lose your way. We get agitated or defensive, and we don't really know why. We find it tricky to pin down our goals. We might have some strong opinious, but it can be difficult to explain really why these ideas matters to us.

They remind you what you're capable of. They see the potential in what we're saying,when we can't.
